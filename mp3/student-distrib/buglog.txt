=============cp1======================
1. IDT:
Zibo Lin is responsable for this part. 
	At first, forget to add the assembly language wrapper.
		Fixed soon by adding it.
	Terminal can still accept input after exception.
		Fixed soon by adding cli(); before while(1);

2. RTC:
Peter Cork
	init incorrectly.
		Fixed soon by using the correct IRQ.

3.Paging:
Jinghan Huang
	Order of Initialization
		Change Order of enabling 4MB and enabling paging

4. PIC:
Chao Xu
	Mask interrupt incorrectly
		Mask interrupt independently
	


============cp2=======================
1. Terminal read
Zibo Lin
	Pressing "enter" can't read-in.
		Fixed by adding a volatile flag to detect the "enter" pressing

2. vertical scorlling
Jinghan Huang
	Can't work.
		Fixed by writing a lot of codes in putc, keyboard interrupt handler, update_cursor and etc.

3. Keyboard read-in
Chao Xu
	Upper case alphabet letter always followed by a lower case letter.
		Fixed by init the key_map in .c file

4.Typeing too fast
All
	If typing some chars just after pressing enter, the screen will print the chars at the beginning of new line which shouldn't.
		Turn out not to be a bug since the provided "hello" program doed the same thing.

5.rtc 
Peter Cork
	Weird page fault.
		Fixed by rewriting the code.

==============cp3=======================
1.Halt
Jinghan Huang
	Exit the program incorrectly, page fault.
		Fixed by changing the pcb_index remapping part.

2.Execute
Chao Xu
	Parse arguement incorrectly.
		Fixed


==============cp4======================
1. syserr5
Jinghan Huang
	Missing one validity check.
		Added.

2. grep fault
Jinghan Huang
	Missing validity check
		Added

3.Pingpong page fault
Jinghan Huang
	add the rtc_ops_init in the file.c 

4.verylongtextwithverylongfilename.txt
Jinghan Huang
	implement extra function: arguement "verylongtextwithverylongfilename.txt' can be used as well.
		deleted


=============cp5================================
1.Running any program for 19 times guarantees a page fault
Jinghan Huang & Zibo Lin 
	halt doesn't change the tss.esp0 correctly, fixed.

2.schedule can't work
Jinghan Huang & Zibo Lin & Peter Cork
	Add operations on the tss

3.switch terms cause scheduling error
Jinghan Huang
	launch all the 3 terms when init the scheduling

4.switch terms can't read arguement correctly
Jinghan Huang & Zibo Lin
	Fixed by changing the sequence of two lines


=============EC================================
1.Mouse
Chao Xu
Mouse has some problems in switching terminals and vertical scrolling
	Switch mouse informations when switching
